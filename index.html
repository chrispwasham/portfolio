			<h1>Chris P Washam</h1>
			<h2>Front-end Web Developer</h2>
			<a class="btn" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrispwasham/">LinkedIn</a>
			<p>I got my start as a web designer and developer in the late 90s, back when AltaVista and Netscape Navigator were a big deal.  That's right.  A lot has changed since then!</p>
			<p>From 20+ years of experience, my knowledge of the core languages of the web - HTML, CSS and JavaScript - is <em>very</em> thorough.  Along the way, I have added to my modern toolbox with jQuery, SASS, XML/XSL, ARIA, JavaScript plugins, frameworks (such as Bootstrap, Foundation, RequireJS) and a host of development, productivity and content management applications.  Not to mention making techniques like responsive design and accessibility part of standard web development practice.  The web is constantly evolving and I have enthusiastically grown along with it.  I embrace every new challenge - learning and problem-solving is fun!</p>

							<p>As a member of a small team in support of <a href="https://www.enbridge.com">Enbridge.com</a>, my role was to develop and deliver enhancements to the website, review and scope requests for new work, gather requirements and propose solutions, perform code reviews, test and validate changes, maintain team standards and run code release deployments to production.</p>
							<p>Enhancements that I developed included:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>New functionality</li>
								<li>User experience enhancements</li>
								<li>Accessibility compliance (WCAG)</li>
								<li>Page layout and section redesigns</li>
								<li>Content authoring enhancements in Sitecore</li>
								<li>Bug fixes</li>
							</ul>
							<p>In this project, I gained experience with full-stack web application design in Visual Studio, Foundation framework for the user interface and modular JavaScript with RequireJS.</p>

I integrated and adapted the page templates and components into our existing content management system (CMS) and provided all ongoing enhancements and support.</p>
							<p>Enhancements for this project included:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>New page layout and section designs</li>
								<li>Full functional solution for incident response</li>
								<li>Customization of the CMS for authoring components (reducing the need for technical support)</li>
							</ul>
							<p>In this project, I gained experience with Bootstrap framework for responsive user interface, SASS for CSS and XSL transformations for the XML-based CMS templates.</p>
							<p>Spectra Energy merged with Enbridge in 2017.  Post-merger, I also integrated both Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners websites into Enbridgeâ€™s Sitecore CMS.</p>

I provided all ongoing enhancements and support, adapting the design to suit the business' changing needs.</p>
							<p>For Spectra Energy and Spectra Energy Partners, I was also responsible for managing the design and configuration of the server and publishing architecture for the websites, including disaster recovery failover and code deployment solutions.</p>

					<div class="wrap">
						<div class="blurb">
							<p>I spent 10 years as the primary front-end developer for a SharePoint-based employee portal for a Fortune 500 company.  I worked in SharePoint versions 2007, 2010 and 2013 and created all branding of the platform and components, making the site responsive with restructured HTML and CSS.  I created custom master pages, page layouts and a number of web part designs using XSL transformations with content query and data view web parts. The XSL-based web parts allowed easy content management by using only SharePoint lists and libraries with unique data columns as the content source.</p>
							<p>I developed a number of additional user experience enhancements to augment the portal, which involved combining SharePoint functionality with custom HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create unique and dynamic user experiences.</p>
							<p>Some of the solutions I created or helped design:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Customized (and editable) multi-level menu navigation experience</li>
								<li>Key message and content promotion</li>
								<li>Content localization by region</li>
								<li>Personalized page bookmarking</li>
								<li>Enhanced search</li>
							</ul>
							<p>In this role, I also created detailed training materials, guides and user manuals and conducted group and individual training sessions enterprise-wide.</p>

							<p>In my most recent position, I built new sites and migrated and enhanced existing sites in the Sitecore content management system.  I experienced working with a complex code base in Visual Studio, supporting many websites.  I was hands-on developing and working with Sitecore pages and components, templates, layouts, placeholders, renderings and ensuring elements were Experience Editor-friendly for authors.</p>
							<p>The site structures made extensive use of form-based templates and reusable content components to populate pages, making the authoring experience simple for business users.</p>

					<div class="wrap">
						<div class="blurb">
							<p>For the better part of a year in 2019-20, I worked on a project to improve the accessibility profile of a large corporate website.  Following Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), WAI-ARIA and published and tested design patterns, I enhanced page structures; complex tools like a navigation dashboard, interactive forms and selectors; dynamically changing content with moving focus; and numerous interactive page components.</p>
							<p>I ensured that these enhancements provided comprehensive keyboard control (with visual indicators of keyboard focus), logical progression in keeping with the visual layout, as well as proper structure, semantics and supplemental audio support for the visually impaired.</p>
							<p>In this project, I learned how to think through the user experience from different points of view, and using tools and browser plug-ins to report accessibility errors and test and validate solutions.</p>

							<p>Okay, this is not really a project, but it is an area of professional development. I spent 3 years on a team in a structured development environment within a large corporate IT department.  We used JIRA for work management, tracking enhancements and bug fixes through stages on a Kanban board.  Work was broken down into small chunks that could be bundled into regular code releases for continual improvement.  Code reviews, multiple rounds of testing through QA and UAT and business partner reviews, when appropriate, were standard practice.</p>
							<p>We also leveraged internal applications for version control, automated continuous integration, and a system for tracking issues and change management.</p>
